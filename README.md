This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates time series forecasting using Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and  Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. ARMA and ARIMA are popular methods for analyzing and predicting future values based on historical data. Here I forecast short-term future electricity demand using historical data. Prediction quality is evaluated using RMSE.
